### Hi there! 😁

My name is Thiago Ribeiro from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm an enthusiastic of tecnology. Dependant of knowledge. I don't have fear about changes, even because I changed from +10 years Mainframe dev to mobile dev and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career. I'm Full Stack Developer at [Sabion Digital](http://sabion.com.br/).

In my free time I like to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵), to learn about everythin I can and eventually I like to philosophize about life.

Would you like to find me?
